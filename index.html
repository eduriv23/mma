                <h3>Extremely interesting facts about the desert metropolis named Phoenix:</h3>
                <p>6. South Mountain Park Is the Nation's Largest City Park… it’s nearly 20 times the size of New York's Central Park.</p>
                <p>5. By Land Area, Phoenix Is Bigger Than New York and Los Angeles… There are only a few major American cities larger than Phoenix (Anchorage, Alaska; Jacksonville, Florida; Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; and Houston, Texas).</p>
                <p>4. Parts of Downtown Were Built Over 3,000-Year-Old Ruins built by the Hohokam native american people.</p>
                <p>3. Phoenix Is the Most-Populated State Capital in the country… At almost 1.5 million people, Phoenix is much larger than the second-biggest capital, Indianapolis, which is home to about 850,000 people.</p>
                <p>2. Only 40 Percent of Phoenix Residents Were Born in Arizona… Beyond that, most suburbs of Phoenix have even lower rates of Arizona-born people.</p>
                <p>1. The Definition of "Downtown Phoenix” is approximately from 7th Ave to 7th Street, and from the railroad tracks to McDowell… North of that is Midtown, and north of Indian School Road is Uptown.<br><br>
